## Introduction

<p class="message">
Welcome to my website, my name is Vincent. If you want to learn more about me, you are in the right place! I am currently in my final year of studies in my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, double majoring in statistics and economics. As you can tell with my program of choice, I am very keen and interested in working with data. Recongizing the rapid expansion of the global datasphere, I have also picked up an interest in AI. I love learning how data is being used in the business world, it is always intreguting what unexpected relationship can be explored with data. And I believe that this is what I want my career to be about, there are so many interesting hidden relationships that are not yet discovered that can be used in different aspect in business.

## Personal and School Projects


<a style="color:black" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/assets/Election.pdf" target="_blank"> **Predicting the 2025 Canadian Federal Election** </a> <span> | Co-author | November 2021 </span>


Using a census dataset and a survey dataset to constrcut a multilevel model with post-stratification to predcit the winner of the popular vote of the 2025 Federal Election. The survey data serves as a sample and contains information about voters preferences and their characteristics.

**Covid Uncertainty Index: Using news and sentiments in news to predict market movement**| Author | October 2021

The goal of this project to is determine whether news sentiment and frequency of COVID being mentioned in news has predictive power on the stock market. I gathered news headlines using by webscraping using Selenium and Python. Performed topic modelling is then to insight of text data on specific new topics to build a dictionary in order to identify COVID related news titles. Using the dictionary created and Natural Language Processing techniques to create "COVID-19 uncertainty index" and  "News sentiment index". These two indexes have a value of correlation of ~0.1 and ~0.07 with the S&P500.

<a style="color:black" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/assets/Covid.pdf" target="_blank"> **Unmasking Covid Misinformation** </a> <span> | Author | December 2021 </span>

This report aims to debunk the myth that COVID is just another flu using a straightforward and easy to understand statistical method called Difference in Difference. This report found that the death count data across different provinces in Canada follows very similar trends. Which makes the provinces within the Atlantic Bubble a perfect source to be used to estimate the counterfactual of death in other provinces. The idea is that since the provinces withing the Atlatic Bubble have prolonged period of 0 cases of COVID-19, the difference in trend in difference provines can be contributed to the introduction of COVID-19. The difference in death count were founded to be statistically significant when comparing the provinces in the Atlantic Bubble and other provinces.
