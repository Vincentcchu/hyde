## Introduction

<p class="message">
Welcome to my website, my name is Vincent. If you want to learn more about me, you are in the right place! I am currently in my final year of studies in my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, double majoring in statistics and economics. As you can tell with my program of choice, I am very keen and interested in working with data. Recongizing the rapid expansion of the global datasphere, I have also picked up an interest in AI. I love learning how data is being used in the business world, it is always intreguting what unexpected relationship can be explored with data. And I believe that this is what I want my career to be about, there are so many interesting hidden relationships that are not yet discovered that can be used in different aspect in business.
