## Introduction

<p class="message">
Welcome to my website, my name is Vincent. If you want to learn more about me, you are in the right place! I am currently in my final year of studies in my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, double majoring in statistics and economics. As you can tell with my program of choice, I am very interested in working with data. Recognizing the rapid expansion of the global datasphere, I have also picked up Machine Learning(ML). The aspect of ML that I find especially interesting is its ability to process text data, since that is something that traditional algorithms are not capable of. It is always intriguing to see what unexpected relationships can be explored with data.For this reason, I believe that this is what I want my career to be about, as there are so many interesting not yet discovered relationships that I can apply in business settings and hopefully create some impacts.

## Personal and School Projects


<a style="color:black" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/assets/Covid.pdf" target="_blank"> **Unmasking Covid Misinformation** </a> <span> | Author | December 2021 </span>

This report aims to debunk the myth that COVID-19 is just another flu by using a straightforward and easy to understand statistical method called Difference in Difference. This report found that the death count data across different provinces in Canada follows very similar trends, which makes the provinces within the Atlantic Bubble a perfect source to be used to estimate the counterfactual of death in other provinces. The idea is that since the provinces within the Atlantic Bubble have prolonged periods of 0 cases of COVID-19, the difference in trend in difference provinces can be attributed to the introduction of COVID-19. The difference in death count was found to be statistically significant when comparing the provinces in the Atlantic Bubble and other provinces.




<a style="color:black" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/assets/Election.pdf" target="_blank"> **Predicting the 2025 Canadian Federal Election** </a> <span> | Co-author | November 2021 </span>


Using a census dataset and a survey dataset to construct a multilevel model with post-stratification to predict the winner of the popular vote of the 2025 Federal Election. The survey data serves as a sample and contains information about voters preferences and their characteristics. The model is built on the survey data that is then post-stratified onto the census data to draw the conclusion that the Conservative party of Canada will be the most likely to win the popular vote in the 2025 Federal Election.



**Covid Uncertainty Index: Using news and sentiments in news to predict market movement**| Author | In Progress

The goal of this project is to determine whether news sentiments and frequency of COVID-19 being mentioned in the news has predictive power on the stock market. I gathered news headlines by webscraping using Selenium and Python.  Topic modelling is then performed to gain insight of text data on specific new topics to build a dictionary in order to identify COVID-19 related news titles. Using the dictionary created and Natural Language Processing techniques to create the "COVID-19 uncertainty index" and the "News sentiment index". I found that these two indexes have a value of correlation of ~0.1 and ~0.07 with the S&P500.
